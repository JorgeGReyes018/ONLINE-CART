This project uses HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, & JAVASCRIPT

My name is Jorge G Reyes and this is my third project where I needed to code a type of list. 
I decided to make an online shopping cart because I used to run an online business of my own.
I hope to code the entire site from scratch and reopen the company with more products so this is the start of that.

You should be able to navigate to my GIPHY API from the top in the my works section and the other links refer to the rest of my Portfolio.
